Group Meeting
11/24/2013

Goal: Have a model ready to present by Tuesday.

Tasks:
-Understand Luen’s error code/ write our own
  -Code ECDF model (This is a challenge)
  -figure out eg. swarms
  -error on test set (Dataframe: data2)
  -plots
  -We don’t know how to generate error diagrams using this.

MDA Model…(socal Data: data1)
  -need to know Luen’s error diagram code….
  -Haven’t tried this on a large data set….
  -we know how to generate errors using his
Presentation on above by Tuesday!!!
Communicate with the other Analyzer group on what they are working on and see how we can sync up. (Theresa)

What do we have?
  -Code by luen
  -ECDF code by us

Data
-Socal data as provided by professor Luen (“socal.txt”, 8,000) 
-Dataframe as provided by the curators (dropbox, 600,000,000)
-1938-2012 socal.

Today:
We chose to focus on ECDF Model:

Look at more than first successors
   - how many successors?
   - We will look at first successors.
   - is there a cutoff?
   - do aftershocks happen after a certain number of days?
window time?

Figure out get around for swarm/other types of earthquakes
Build code that generates error rates
      -What is ECDF function outputs
      -We don’t have a ECDF function. What type of function do we want.
